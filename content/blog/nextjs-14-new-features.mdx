## 🚀 React 19 + Server Components by Default

Next.js 16 now fully embraces **React 19**, unlocking stable **React Server Components (RSC)** and **enhanced Suspense boundaries** out of the box.

This means:
- **Zero unnecessary JavaScript** on the client
- **Seamless async data fetching** inside components
- **Better interactivity and performance**

```tsx
// app/page.tsx
export default async function Home() {
  const res = await fetch("https://api.example.com/posts", { cache: "no-store" });
  const posts = await res.json();

  return (
    <section>
      <h1 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Latest Posts</h1>
      <ul>
        {posts.map((post: any) => (
          <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </section>
  );
}
